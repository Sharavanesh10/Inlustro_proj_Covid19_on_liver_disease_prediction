Data Sources
COVID-19 datasets: [Provide source(s) for COVID-19 data].
Liver disease datasets: [Provide source(s) for liver disease data].
Literature Review
Summarize key findings from relevant studies on COVID-19 and liver disease.
Highlight potential risk factors, mechanisms, and predictive markers identified in the literature.
Data Preprocessing
Describe steps taken to clean and preprocess the data.
Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and perform data transformations if necessary.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize distributions, correlations, and trends in the data.
Explore relationships between COVID-19 variables, liver function tests, and other clinical parameters.
Feature Engineering
Create new features or transformations based on domain knowledge or insights from EDA.
Select relevant features for predictive modeling.
Model Development
Implement machine learning models for predicting liver disease complications in COVID-19 patients.
Choose appropriate algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost).
Tune hyperparameters and evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
Model Evaluation
Assess the performance of predictive models using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves.
Discuss strengths, limitations, and potential areas for improvement.
Conclusion
Summarize key findings and insights from the analysis.
Discuss implications for clinical practice, public health, and future research directions.
